# GPT-5.1-Codex

Summary: GPT-5.1-Codex is a code-optimized variant of the GPT-5.1 family tuned for reliable, high-throughput code generation, completion, and program understanding tasks.

Strengths:
- Precise code completions and refactorings
- Good at multi-language generation (Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, etc.)
- Helpful for automated code review and documentation generation

Recommended use cases:
- In-editor completions, CI-driven code generation, automated refactors, and code explanation tools.

Notes:
